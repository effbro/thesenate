At the start of battle, other Hutt Cartel allies gain a stack of My Kind of Scum for each Bounty Hunter, Hutt Cartel, and Smuggler ally until the end of the battle, which can't be copied, dispelled, or prevented.

When Jabba the Hutt is in the Leader slot, the following Contract is active:

Contract: While buffed with My Kind of Scum, deal damage with an attack to enemies with Thermal Detonators 20 times. Enemies must be debuffed with Thermal Detonators before the start of an attack to count progress. (Only Bounty Hunter, Hutt Cartel, and Smuggler allies can contribute to the Contract.)

During raids, this contract is fulfilled immediately at the start of battle.

Reward: All Bounty Hunter allies have their payouts activated, and all Bounty Hunter, Hutt Cartel, and Smuggler allies gain 25% Defense Penetration, Offense, and Potency. Allies with My Kind of Scum have +55% Mastery for each stack and recover 20% Protection at the start of their turn.</td><td>1</td><td>100 %</td></tr><tr><td data-order="specialskill_JABBATHEHUTT01"><img src="https://game-assets.swgoh.gg/tex.ability_jabbathehutt_special01.png" style="width: 30px" /> Crime Lord</td><td>Dispel all debuffs on allies and inflict Speed Down for 2 turns on all enemies.

Inflict a Thermal Detonator on all enemies for 2 turns. Inflict an additional Thermal Detonator on all enemies for 2 turns for every 20% Ultimate Charge Jabba the Hutt has. Whenever a Thermal Detonator from this ability expires, all Bounty Hunter, Hutt Cartel, and Smuggler allies gain 2% Mastery until the end of the encounter. This ability can't be resisted.</td><td>1</td><td>100 %</td></tr><tr><td data-order="uniqueskill_GALACTICLEGEND01"><img src="https://game-assets.swgoh.gg/tex.abilityui_passive_galacticlegend.png" style="width: 30px" /> Galactic Legend</td><td>This unit takes reduced damage from percent Health damage effects and massive damage effects.

If Jabba the Hutt is not in the allied Leader slot, allies can't gain bonus Turn Meter.

If Jabba the Hutt is in the allied Leader slot, whenever an enemy with less than 100% Turn Meter gains bonus Turn Meter, Hutt Cartel allies gain 7% Turn Meter (limit once per turn). Whenever a Hutt Cartel ally loses Turn Meter, they gain Bonus Protection (20%, stacking) until the start of their next turn.</td><td>1</td><td>100 %</td></tr></table><br/><br/><div id="gearLevels-chart" style="width:80%;height:800px" /><script>
